# falconre

Falconre is a python3 library using [pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) to wrap:

  * [Falcon](https://github.com/falconre/falcon) - A binary analysis framework in Rust
  * [Finch](https://github.com/falconre/finch) - A symbolic executor built on Falcon
  * _[Raptor](https://github.com/falconre/raptor) - Higher order IR and analysis on top of Falcon_ Raptor support is currently disabled.

This is alpha-quality software.

## What is this really?

This is me (endeav0r) hacking on Falcon and other things to try and automate
different analysis tasks. This library remains in flux.

Here are some things you can try:

### Print out all the function calls in a program

```bash
git clone https://github.com/endeav0r/corpora
git clone https://github.com/falconre/falconre

# Build some example programs
pushd corpora
./build.sh
popd

# Build falconre in a Docker container
pushd falconre
docker build -t falconre .
# Watch youtube, this will take a few minutes
popd

docker run --rm -ti -v $(pwd):/opt falconre \
  python3 /opt/falconre/examples/print-calls.py \
  /opt/corpora/build/stack_buffer/vuln/one

```

### Find trivial stack buffer overflows

```bash
# Run the example stack-writes.py script against a trivially vulnerable stack
# buffer overflow program.
docker run --rm -ti -v $(pwd):/opt falconre \
  python3 /opt/falconre/examples/stack-writes.py \
  /opt/corpora/build/stack_buffer/vuln/one

# Run the example stack-writes.py against a non-vulnerable version of the same
# program.
docker run --rm -ti -v $(pwd):/opt falconre \
  python3 /opt/falconre/examples/stack-writes.py \
  /opt/corpora/build/stack_buffer/not_vuln/one
```

### Symbolically execute a toy amd64 assembly function

```bash
docker run --rm -ti -v $(pwd):/opt falconre \
  python3 /opt/falconre/examples/symex-one.py \
  /opt/corpora/build/symex/one
```

### Print out DOT graph of Falcon IL

```bash
docker run --rm -ti -v $(pwd):/opt falconre \
  python3 /opt/falconre/examples/falcon-dot-graph.py \
  /opt/corpora/build/symex/one run | dot -Tpng -o /tmp/main.png
```

# Installing

## Docker

```
docker build -t falconre .
```

## Natively on OSX

_This is how I use falconre._

Install rust:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Get the dependencies. _Note: You must have capstone 4.0.2 to use falcon._

```
brew install z3 capstone
```

Install with setuptools

```
python3 setup.py install
```

If you don't want to install with setuptools, assuming you want to run the
examples:

```
cargo build --release
cp target/release/libfalconre.dylib examples/falconre.so
```
